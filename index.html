      <h1>About</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Jewish culture is one of the oldest in the world. Because their roots go back so far, many Jews feel a strong connection with the past. They also feel that understanding their history will help them better follow Jewish teachings. Their traditions and holy days help them understand and celebrate their history. </h5>

      <h1>Holidays</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">  One Jewish tradition is celebrated by Hanukkah, which falls in December. It honors the rededication of the Second Temple during the revolt of the Maccabees. The Maccabees wanted to celebrate a great victory that had convinced their non-Jewish rulers to let them keep their religion. According to legend, though, the Maccabees didn't have enough lamp oil to perform the rededication ceremony. Miraculously, the oil they had-enough to burn for only one day-burned for eight full days. Today jews celebrate this event by lighting candles in a special candleholder called a menorah (muh-NOHR-uh). Its eight branches represent the eight days through which the oil burned. Many jews also exchange gifts on each of the eight nights.   </h5>
 
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">More important than Hanukkah to jews,
Passover is celebrated in March or April.
Passover is a time for jews to remember the
Exodus, the journey of the Hebrews out of
slavery in Egypt.
According to ] ewish tradition, the
Hebrews left Egypt so quickly that bakers
didn't have time to let their bread rise.
Therefore, during Passover jews eat only
matzah, a flat, unrisen bread. They also celebrate
the holy day with ceremonies and a
ritual meal called a seder. During
the seder, participants recall and reflect
upon the events of the Exodus. </h5>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Ceremonies and rituals are also part of the
High Holy Days, the two most sacred of all
Jewish holy days. They take place each year
in September or October. The first two days
of the celebration, Rosh Hashanah (rahsh
uh-SHAH-nuh), celebrate the beginning of a
new year in the Jewish calendar.
On Yom Kippur,
which falls soon afterward, Jews ask God
to forgive their sins. Jews consider Yom
Kippur to be the holiest day of the entire
year. Because it is so holy, jews don't eat
or drink anything for the entire day. Many
of the ceremonies they perform for Yom
Kippur date back to the days of the Second
Temple. These ceremonies help many jews
feel more connected to their long past, to
the days of Abraham and Moses. </h5>
