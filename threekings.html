        <a-text value="Saul, the first king" position="-0.5 1.5 2"></a-text>
        <a-text value="Saul was the first leader of the Israelites. \n
        He had some success as a military commander, but he wasn't a strong king.\n 
        He never won the total support of tribal and religious leaders, who often fought against his decisions."

        <a-text value="David, the second king" position="5.25 1.5 8"></a-text>
        <a-text value="Unlike Saul, David was well loved by the Israelites. 
        He won the full support of Israel's tribal leaders. 
        David was admired for his military skills and as a poet; many of the Psalms are attributed to him. 
        He established the capital of Israel in Jerusalem. " position="4 1.5 3"></a-text>

     <a-text value="Solomon, the third king" position="11 1.5 -3"></a-text> 
     <a-text value="David's son Solomon (SAHL-uh-muhn) took the throne in about 965 BC. 
                    Like his father, Solomon was a strong king. He expanded the kingdom and made nearby kingdoms,
                    including Egypt and Phoenicia, his allies. Trade with these allies made Israel very rich.
                    With these riches, Solomon built a great temple to God in Jerusalem. 
                    This temple became the center of the Israelites' religious life and a symbol of their faith."
